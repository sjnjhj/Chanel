            <p>So like, I was known for best hair and stuff. I always have my roots showing porque I'm Latina. My favorite colored contacts are blue. <em>...No So-C they're blue
              not brown!</em> I guess you could say I was the bad girl in skewl, always getting into trouble and stuff. All the boys want me because I'm like cute, unlike Soo-C. 
              My boyfriend of the week is Papasito. Heee's super handsome. And he has like a lot of money... heh heh. <em>...Shut up So-C! I'm not with him for his money! You're 
              just jealous!</em> My favorite brands are like real high end. I have a lot of bags like Kors, Coach, Dooney... you know like all the popular ones that are in
              right now. In case you were wondering, that wasn't me on the news with my cunada So-C. It just looks like us. I swear we didn't steal from Wal-Mart. I don't even
              shop there. <em>Shut up So-C! It wasn't us! Stop lying.</em> There's like a lot more I can say about myself, pero there's a sale at Ross right now I got to get to.
              <em>Get the keys and your wallet So-C!</em>
